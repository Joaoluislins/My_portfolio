Brief passage through my Data / AI journey \
<br />


### (In progress) Deploy of a algorithmic stock trading strategy with a deep learning model (LSTM Keras) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_bsndj48XWm6H6cxDTaKKhBGTNuHgGLE?usp=sharing)
*Predicting Stock's price movement.*
> The main objectives of this project are: understand advanced deep learning models inner structures; comprehend the whole cycle of the data throughout a model in production.
The deploy of the model is going to be made in AWS.

Project built by personal motivation. Accompanied by the mentors of the Data Engineering bootcamp at [How Bootcamps](https://howedu.com.br/cohort/engenharia-de-dados/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAmpyRBhC-ARIsABs2EAqENMpiYYuGn9bKLYI-btMdAS8R3be_UNzxraVEg4tDxT1Rkka8vRAaAsG5EALw_wcB).

### Predicting used Toyota car prices from a UK dealership store. - (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic, Stochastic GradientBoosting) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cfcp4IqrQjQhdSYwWXZNsaxQXz1TvTiG?usp=sharing)

> The objective of this study was to advise the Sales team into pricing used cars that arrive on a UK dealership store.
By analyzing the given dataset, collected from other retailers, I could:

- Infer the aspects of a car that are most relevant in predicting it's selling price.
- Create a predictive pricing model that works well within a £1500 error's limit range.

### Predicting rent prices in StreetEasy, a Real Estate marketplace. - Multiple Linear Regression  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joaoluislins/StreetEasy_Codecademy/blob/main/project.ipynb)

> The objective of the project was to predict rent prices, applying Multiple Linear Regression in 14 feats, working with Python and a dataset that contains a sample of 5,000 rentals listings in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, active on StreetEasy in June 2016.

### Predicting the insurance charging cost of a US citizen. - Multiple Linear Regression // Data exploration  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joaoluislins/us_insurance_costs/blob/main/US_Insurance_costs.ipynb)

> The objective of the project was to build a python algorithm to analyze the data and the influence of 14 feats on US insurance costs, no framework was given and I could choose whatever aspects I would like to focus into.
