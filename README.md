### Pricing Toyota cars - (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic, Stochastic GradientBoosting) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cfcp4IqrQjQhdSYwWXZNsaxQXz1TvTiG?usp=sharing)
*Predicting used Toyota car prices from a UK dealership store.*

> The objective of this study was to advise the Sales team into pricing used cars that arrive on a UK dealership store.
By analyzing the given dataset, collected from other retailers, I could:

- Infer the aspects of a car that are most relevant in predicting it's selling price.
- Create a predictive pricing model that works well within a £1500 error's limit range.

> The objective of the project was to predict rent prices, applying Multiple Linear Regression in 14 feats, working with Python and a dataset that contains a sample of 5,000 rentals listings in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, active on StreetEasy in June 2016.

Project built as part of the Data Scientist Career Certification, provided by [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). \
Partnership between StreetEasy and Codecademy to provide a real business case study.

*StreetEasy is New York City's leading real estate marketplace.*

### US insurance costs - Multiple Linear Regression // Data exploration  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joaoluislins/us_insurance_costs/blob/main/US_Insurance_costs.ipynb)
*Predicting the insurance charging cost of a US citizen.*

> The objective of the project was to build a python algorithm to analyze the data and the influence of 14 feats on US insurance costs, no framework was given and I could choose whatever aspects I would like to focus into.
